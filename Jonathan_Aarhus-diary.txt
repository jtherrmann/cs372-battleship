Developer Diary for Battleship Project

By Jonathan Aarhus

February 11

We've mostly gone over brainstorming of user stories and ranked them by priory of completion and time
required to complete. The gist of this is that we need to focus on the back-end of code that codifies
the rules of the game so that we can work on the user interface later. If we get to the user intyerface
we will probabaly start with a simple text based UI that will function as a test for the backed. Then, 
time permitting, we can move on to implementing of two player version that can work over the web.

We've also established the we can meet in persion to do pair programming on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well
as the weekends. By my estimation we would need to work together for at least an hour ber session to meet our
requirements.

February 12 to Februaru 27

We met on the 14th for an hour to discuss our general plan for the project. Then we met on the 16th for an hour and a half to do
our first pair programming session. We began by wrighting tests to cover the first user story. On the 21st I spent about 2 hours on 
my own studying python for the projects, and on the same day we met for about 2 hours to finish the first user story.
We also met on the 22nd for an hour to do some more pair programming. On the 27th we met for a half hour to prepare for the
presentation.
