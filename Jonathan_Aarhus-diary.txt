Developer Diary for Battleship Project

By Jonathan Aarhus

February 11

We've mostly gone over brainstorming of user stories and ranked them by priory of completion and time
required to complete. The gist of this is that we need to focus on the back-end of code that codifies
the rules of the game so that we can work on the user interface later. If we get to the user intyerface
we will probabaly start with a simple text based UI that will function as a test for the backed. Then, 
time permitting, we can move on to implementing of two player version that can work over the web.

We've also established the we can meet in persion to do pair programming on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well
as the weekends. By my estimation we would need to work together for at least an hour ber session to meet our
requirements.
