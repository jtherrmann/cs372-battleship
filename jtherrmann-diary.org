* Jake Herrmann project diary
** Fri Feb 8 2019
*** 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm (in class)
- Read the articles linked in the assignment description.
- Brainstormed user stories.
- Had a conversation about each story from the perspective of both project
  owners / players and developers.
- Prioritized the user stories (as project owners).
** Sun Feb 10 2019
*** 10:50 am - 11:55 am
- Set up a GitHub repo for the project.
- Recorded our prioritized user stories to the README.
- Found my family's Battleship game and reviewed the rules.
*** 12:10 pm - 12:25 pm
- Revised some user stories.
*** Afternoon and evening
- We agreed on difficulty ratings over Slack. Oddly enough, we only used 1 and
  8 hr. ratings. I'm guessing some of the 1 hr. items might become 2 or 4 hours
  realistically, when you account for writing tests, refactoring, etc.
- We also agreed on an initial design based on our higher priority user
  stories.
