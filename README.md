# CS 372 Battleship

## Initial requirements

User stories, from highest to lowest priority:

- As a player, I want to choose an initial configuration for my ships.
  - The computer should automatically restrict me to legal configurations, e.g.
    no diagonal placement, no overlapping ships, etc.
- As a player, I want the full range of ship sizes.
  - Destroyer - 2 holes
  - Submarine - 3 holes
  - Cruiser - 3 holes
  - Battleship - 4 holes
  - Carrier - 5 holes
- As a player, I want to choose where to attack on the board.
  - I should automatically see whether it was a hit or a miss and the computer
    should store this information for later reference.
- As a player, I want to check the current status of the game.
  - I should be able to see my own ship configuration and the hits and misses
    that have been made on my grid, but I should only be able to see the hits
    and misses that have been made on my opponentâ€™s grid (but not their ship
    configuration).
- As a player, I want ships to be sunk when appropriate.
  - Ships should sink when all of their holes have been hit.
- As a player, I want to win or lose when appropriate.
  - A player should lose when all of their ships have been sunk.
- As a player, I want a text-based interface in order to test these features.
  - As players / project owners, we are most interested in seeing a working
    implementation of the game logic, even if it has no user interface and can
    only be confirmed to work using automated tests. However, we would
    eventually like a simple textual interface with which to test the features
    interactively.
- As a player, I want to play against another player on a single computer.
  - As an extension of the text-based interface idea, we also want to be able
    to take turns at the keyboard in order to play against another human (or
    just play against ourselves).
- As a player, I want to play against a remote opponent.
  - As players / project owners we would eventually like to be able to play
    against a remote opponent, preferably over an internet connection. This is
    important because it allows us to play against friends at any time and
    because it makes it easier to avoid seeing your opponent's view of the game
    (which will be a limitation of using a single computer).
- As a player, I would eventually like a GUI.
  - As players / project owners we are more interested in seeing a fully
    functioning battleship game with a simple text interface before seeing any
    sort of GUI. As developers we respond that it would be convenient to
    implement a GUI when we implement networked multiplayer, because we could
    convert the game to a web app. As players / project owners, we like this
    idea.
- As a player, I want to play against the computer.
  - Players / project owners and developers agree this can be a low-priority,
    long-term goal. The developers do not know much about AI anyway.
- As a player, I want to play in fully 3-D virtual reality.
  - All involved parties agree this can be a very low-priority goal for the
    very distant future.
